### This chat application is created by Rohit Roshan Sahu. 

## I wasn't able to add firebase auth or socket.io due to the lack of time I have implemented the message like feature only . I haven't taken any help of external websites like chat GPT or other ai platforms to build this. I have used tailwindCSS for styling.
